# import-distance-correlation-to-clustering-with-R
I want to make a new algorithm based on traditional clustering algorithm with a new statistcs value, named distance correlation.
The first-version is different from k-means with the distance correlation.
The second-version is a clustering algorithm which do not need a center in each cluster but try to make every cluster not more indepedent.
