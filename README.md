# import-distance-correlation-to-clustering-with-R
I want to make a new algorithm based on traditional clustering algorithm with a new statistcs value, named distance correlation.
in the branch named the first version, I used the distance-correlation instead of the Euclidean Distance to be the metric of the new clustering algorithm.
